# xsbt-coverall-plugin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/theon/xsbt-coveralls-plugin.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/theon/xsbt-coveralls-plugin)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/theon/xsbt-coveralls-plugin/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/theon/xsbt-coveralls-plugin)

SBT plugin that uploads scala code coverage to [https://coveralls.io](https://coveralls.io) and integrates with [Travis CI](#travis-ci-integration). This plugin uses [scct](http://mtkopone.github.com/scct/) to generate the code coverage metrics.

For an example project that uses this plugin [click here](https://github.com/theon/scala-uri)

For example output [click here](https://coveralls.io/builds/6727)

## New in 0.0.3

 * You must now add `seq(com.github.theon.coveralls.CoverallsPlugin.coverallsSettings: _*)` to your `build.sbt`. This is to support multi project builds.
 * Multi project build support!
 * Bug Fix: unicode characters in source files now decoded/encoded correctly
 * New ways to [specify your repo token](#specifying-your-repo-token)
 * Support for [different source file encodings](#custom-source-file-encoding)

## Installation

1) Adding the following to your `project/build.sbt` file

```scala
resolvers ++= Seq(
    Classpaths.typesafeResolver
    "scct-github-repository" at "http://mtkopone.github.com/scct/maven-repo"
)

addSbtPlugin("reaktor" % "sbt-scct" % "0.2-SNAPSHOT")

addSbtPlugin("com.github.theon" %% "xsbt-coveralls-plugin" % "0.0.3")
```

2) Add the following to the top of your `build.sbt`

```scala
seq(ScctPlugin.instrumentSettings : _*)

seq(com.github.theon.coveralls.CoverallsPlugin.coverallsSettings: _*)
```

Coveralls configuration options (such as [Specifying Your Repo Token](#specifying-your-repo-token)) must come after this line.

3) Register on `https://coveralls.io/` and get a repo token

4) Follow the instructions for either [Travis CI](#travis-ci-integration) or [Manual Usage](#manual-usage)

## Travis CI Integration

`xsbt-coverall-plugin` can be run by [Travis CI](http://about.travis-ci.org/) by following these instructions:

1) Add the following to you `travis.yml`

    script: "sbt coveralls"

2) Job done! Commit these changes to `travis.yml` to kick off your Travis build and you should see coverage reports appear on http://coveralls.io

## Manual Usage

1) Let `xsbt-coverall-plugin` know what you coveralls repo token is. See [Specifying Your Repo Token](#specifying-your-repo-token)

2) In the SBT console run the command `coveralls`. This should run your test suite, generate code coverage reports and upload the reports to `coveralls.io`. After running the command, you should see output similar to the following:

    Uploading to coveralls.io succeeded: Job #17.1
    https://coveralls.io/jobs/12207

For example output [click here](https://coveralls.io/builds/6727)

## Specifying Your Repo Token

There are several ways to tell `xsbt-coverall-plugin` your repo token to support different use cases:

### Write your repo token into a file 

Add the following to your `build.sbt`. The path can be absolute and point to somewhere outside the project or relative and point somewhere inside the project (such as `src/main/resources/token.txt`). 

Just remember: **Do not store repo tokens inside your project if it is in a public git repository!**

```scala
import com.github.theon.coveralls.CoverallsPlugin.CoverallsKeys._

coverallsTokenFile := "/path/to/my/repo/token.txt"
```

### Put your repo token directly in your `build.sbt`

**Do not store repo tokens inside your project if it is in a public git repository!**

```scala
import com.github.theon.coveralls.CoverallsPlugin.CoverallsKeys._

coverallsToken := "my-token"
```

### Add an environment variable

Add an environment variable `COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN`, for example:

    export COVERALLS_REPO_TOKEN=my-token

## Custom Source File Encoding

By default `xsbt-coveralls-plugin` assumes your source files are `UTF-8` encoded. To use a different encoding, add the following to your `build.sbt`

```scala
import com.github.theon.coveralls.CoverallsPlugin.CoverallsKeys._

encoding := "ISO-8859-1"
```

Once the plugin has slurped your source code into memory using the specified encoding, it will be converted into UTF-8 to be sent to the coveralls API. This is because the coveralls API uses a JSON request body and RFC 4627 mandates that [JSON must be UTF encoded](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627#section-3).

## SNAPSHOT Builds

Add the following to your `project/build.sbt` file

```scala
resolvers ++= Seq(
    Classpaths.typesafeResolver,
    "scct-github-repository" at "http://mtkopone.github.com/scct/maven-repo",
    "sonatype-oss-repo" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/groups/public/"
)

addSbtPlugin("reaktor" % "sbt-scct" % "0.2-SNAPSHOT")

addSbtPlugin("com.github.theon" %% "xsbt-coveralls-plugin" % "0.0.4-SNAPSHOT")
```
